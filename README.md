# Todo-App
📝 Project Description:
This is a simple and functional To-Do List Web Application that allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. The application uses local storage to persist tasks even after the browser is closed or the page is refreshed. It is a perfect beginner-friendly project to practice JavaScript, DOM manipulation, local storage API, and responsive UI design using HTML, CSS, and optionally React.js for a more scalable version.

🚀 Features:
✅ Add Task: Users can enter a new task and add it to the task list.

📝 Edit Task: Allows modifying a task after creation.

❌ Delete Task: Users can remove tasks from the list.

🔄 Mark as Completed: Strike-through styling or checkbox toggle to mark tasks as done.

💾 Persistent Storage: All tasks are saved in local storage so data isn't lost on refresh.

🌓 Light/Dark Mode toggle for better UX.

🔍 Search/filter tasks by keywords or status (completed/pending).
